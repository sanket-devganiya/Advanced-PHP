Discuss file handling in PHP, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files.

File handling in PHP allows you to interact with files on the server â€” such as creating, reading, writing, or modifying them. PHP provides a set of built-in functions for these tasks. Here's a detailed discussion on file handling in PHP, covering:


Mode  Meaning                                    
r   Read-only. File must exist.                
r+  Read/write. File must exist.               
w   Write-only. Truncates file or creates new. 
w+  Read/write. Truncates or creates new.      
a   Append-only. Creates new if doesn't exist. 
a+  Read/append. Creates new if not exists.    
x   Create new, write-only. Fails if exists.   
x+  Create new, read/write. Fails if exists.   


Security Tips

    Avoid allowing users to upload arbitrary files without validation.

    Use basename() to avoid directory traversal.

    Ensure proper permissions are set (e.g., chmod).
