//  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP and how it is implemented in PHP

//  What is Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
// Inheritance is an OOP concept where a class (called the child or subclass) inherits properties and methods from another class (called the parent or superclass).

// It allows:

// Code reuse (you donâ€™t have to write the same code again).

// Establishing a "is-a" relationship between classes.

// Extending or modifying behavior of the parent class.
