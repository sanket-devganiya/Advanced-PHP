<?php


//  What is Method Overloading?
// In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), method overloading refers to defining multiple methods with 
// the same name but different parameter lists (e.g., number, type, or order of parameters).It allows 
// you to perform different tasks based on the arguments passed.

//  Note:
// PHP does not support method overloading in the traditional sense like Java or C++ 
// (i.e., you cannot define multiple methods with the same name but different signatures in a class).
