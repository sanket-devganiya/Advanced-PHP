Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:

MVC is a software design pattern commonly used in web development to separate an application into three interconnected components:

1. Model:
   - Represents the data and business logic of the application.
   - Handles data storage, retrieval, and rules for manipulating data.

2. View:
   - Responsible for displaying data to the user.
   - Renders the user interface based on the data provided by the Model.

3. Controller:
   - Acts as an intermediary between Model and View.
   - Handles user input, processes requests, and updates the Model or View as needed.

Advantages of MVC in Web Development:
- Promotes separation of concerns, making code easier to manage and maintain.
- Facilitates parallel development, as developers can work on Models, Views, and Controllers independently.
- Enhances code reusability and scalability.
- Makes testing and debugging simpler by isolating components.
- Encourages organized and structured code, leading to better long-term project health.
