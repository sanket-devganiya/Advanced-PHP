SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to insert or manipulate malicious SQL code in a query through user input fields. This happens when user input is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in SQL statements.

Implications on security:
- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to database data, including sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and personal details.
- Attackers may modify, delete, or corrupt data in the database.
- In severe cases, attackers can execute administrative operations on the database, compromise the entire server, or escalate attacks to other parts of the system.
- SQL injection can lead to data breaches, loss of data integrity, and damage to an organization's reputation.
